This is source-code of 4vet first version, its was created for using with Orthanc.
In this version we want to put a button which bring to our plugin 4vet.
Follow the pdf file : Compilation_Orthanc__4Vet_Linux.pdf (in french : this file is for Orthanc but its the same steps 4vet).
Then follow the pdf file :  Analyse_4vet01.pdf (in french)
We can build and compile it but I think we need to modify the CMakeLists.txt make it work well.
